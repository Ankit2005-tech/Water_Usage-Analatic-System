The Water Usage Analytics System is a data analytics project designed to analyze household water consumption and detect possible wastage.
The project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to load, clean, and analyze water usage data.
It calculates per-person daily water consumption and applies predefined thresholds to classify usage as normal, moderate wastage,
high wastage, or leak detected. Summary statistics and visualizations, including bar charts and pie charts, are used to present insights clearly.
This project helps identify inefficient water usage patterns and supports better water conservation decisions.
